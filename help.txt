Usage: %s [GLOBAL_OPTION] GROUP_DEF [-n GROUP_DEF]...

Randomly chooses images from a list to draw on the X desktop background with
smooth fading transitions.

GLOBAL_OPTION: options that apply to this program in general

  -h, --help                 prints this message
  -s, --fps=FPS              number of intermediary frames per second
                               (must be a non-negative float)
                               default: 60.0
  -d, --duration=DURATION    number of seconds the transition should take
                               (must be a non-negative float)
                               default: 1.0


GROUP_DEF: arguments that define a group. A group consists of a list of targets,
    a list of images, and a randomization method for choosing which images to
    draw on the targets. For each group, use the following format:

GROUP_DEF := [GROUP_OPTION]... [TARGET]... [[IMAGE_OPTION]... IMAGE]...

    options specified in GROUP_OPTION will affect the current and all
        subsequent groups
    options specified in IMAGE_OPTION will affect all subsequent images,
        including images specified in subsequent groups

  -n, --new                  create a new group. Used as a group separator


GROUP_OPTION: options that apply to groups

  -a, --random=RANDOM        specify a randomization mode. This will determine
                               how images will be chosen to get drawn on the
                               targets in a group
                               (RANDOM must be one of the following)
                                 first:
                                     use the first image in the list to draw
                                     on all targets. This mode is deterministic
                                 seq:
                                     use the i-th image to draw on the i-th
                                     target. This mode is deterministic
                                 permute:
                                     for each target, randomly choose an image
                                     (without reuse) to draw
                                 reuse:
                                     for each target, randomly choose an image
                                     (allowing reuse) to draw
                                 choose-one:
                                     randomly choose one image to draw on all
                                     targets
                                 permute-reuse: (default)
                                     try to use the "permute" mode. If there's
                                     not enough images, use the "reuse" mode.


TARGET: specify a region on the X screen to draw images. Each entry will be
    be added to the list of targets in the current group. If none are specified,
    all XRandR CRTCs will be used as the list of target.

  -g, --region=WxH+X+Y       specify a region manually by using (X,Y) as
                               the top left corner and W,H as the dimensions.
                               (W,H,X,Y must all integers. W,H must be positive)
  -m, --monitor=MONITOR      use the XRandR output MONITOR as the region.
                               (MONITOR must be a connected output)
  -e, --screen               use the whole X screen as the region


IMAGE_OPTION: options that apply to images. These options must be specified
    before the images they are meant for

  -x, --transform=XFORM      specify how images should be scaled in regards
                               with their chosen targets
                               (XFORM must be one of the following)
                                 center:
                                     center the image with no scaling
                                 stretch:
                                     fill the target with the image, matching
                                     both width and height and ignoring the
                                     aspect ratio of the image
                                 match-width:
                                     scale the image to match the width of the
                                     target, while maintaining the aspect ratio
                                 match-height:
                                     scale the image to match the height of the
                                     target, while maintaining the aspect ratio
                                 fit:
                                     scale the image to fit inside the target
                                     while maintaining the aspect ratio
                                 fill: (default)
                                     scale the image to fill the entire target
                                     while maintaining the aspect ratio
  -r, --repeat=REPEAT        specifies what to do when the image is too small to
                               fill the target
                               (REPEAT must be one of the following)
                                 none: (default)
                                     no attempt will be made to fill the target
                                 normal:
                                     the image will be tiled to fill the target
                                 pad:
                                     the edges of the images will be stretched
                                     to fill the target
                                 reflect:
                                     like "normal", but adjacent tiles of the
                                     image are mirrored
  -f, --filter=FILTER        specifies which filter to use when scaling images
                               (FILTER must be one of the following)
                                 nearest:
                                     use nearest neighbor when scaling the image
                                 bilinear: (default)
                                     use bilinear interpolation when scaling the
                                     image


IMAGE: specify a candidate image. Each entry will be added to the list of images
    in the current group. At least one image must be specified.

  IMAGE_PATH                 use an image file specified by IMAGE_PATH. Supports
                               a subset of JPEG, PNG, TGA, BMP, PSD, GIF, HDR,
                               PIC and PNM formats.

  -c, --color=COLOR          use a solid color as an image
                               (COLOR must be a valid Xrender color. Some
                                example formats are listed below)
                                 #RRGGBB
                                     where R,G,B are hexadecimal digits
                                 rgba:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB/AAAA
                                     where R,G,B,A are hexadecimal digits, in
                                     lowercase
